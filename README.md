# Realtime Data Analytics Using Apache Spark
Realtime social media data analytics with Apache Spark, Python, Kafka, Pandas, etc


### Description

Project uses Apache Spark functionalities (SparkSQL, Spark Streaming, MLib) to build machine learning models (Batch Processing-Slow) and then apply the model with (Spark Streaming-Fast) to predict new output.

### Data MashUp
We utilize historical and streaming data from different social media networks through network provided APIs.
* Twitter - https://apps.twitter.com/
* MeetUp  - https://secure.meetup.com/meetup_api
